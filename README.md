NOTE: For a tour of the app and its features, check out the presentation video. You can hear me talk awkwardly for 5 minutes and then steal my app idea.

Description:
IPhone app to allow a user to search for a video game and be presented with a map of nearby Gamestop and BestBuy locations with that game in stock. Price and store information also displayed.

The game availability, price, and location information is obtained from a web service I wrote (see GameFinder_WebService).

IMPORTANT: Last I checked, Gamestop had changed their site in a way that broke my web service a bit. It's my fault because I cut some corners by hard-coding some information (this app and web service was originally a school project so I was under a tight deadline). In any case, the app may not fully function due to the web service, not to the app itself.
